## Introduction

This is API for provide to-do-list-2. Made because original API (http://94.74.86.174:8080/api) has been shutdown. This API has same request with same url for avoid crash in app. The difference lies in response for POST, PUT, and DELETE. I made the GET response result like the original one, but still have differences
